<h1>Migration - 04/12/24</h1>
From today, my website has moved from Netlify to Nest, from Hack Club. Nest gives me more control over my hosting, and even opens up potential for my website to have a backend! Due to the differences between the services there may be a few errors here and there, though I believe I have fixed them all. In similar news, some in the past two days I have added: <a href="/mobile">a mobile homepage</a>, <a href="/thetrail">better security to the trail</a>, <a href="https://old.bottom.monster">old.bottom.monster</a> and <a href="/">splash text</a>. So yeah, this website is rapidly improving :D <br>
<br> My email is still provided my Zoho Mail and my domain is still provided by LibreIvan :)
