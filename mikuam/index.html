The Miku Monarchy is a pxls.space faction I co-founded, but, the founder was extremely inactive and many people know me and "Eve of MikuAM". I try to avoid interacting with the Pxls community now. To learn more about it, you can view it's page on the <a href="https://wiki.pxls.space/view/Miku_Monarchy">Pxls wiki</a>, but that's maintained by the community now. There's also a <a href="https://dsc.gg/MikuAM">Discord</a>. <br> <br>
