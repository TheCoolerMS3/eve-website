Hello, fellow High Seas voter! <br>
I have coded a Fitbit OS 5 Clockface themed around Cheesy Hfj's object show "ONE".<br>
Odds are, you do not have a Fitbit OS 5 device, and I am really sorry I can't provide a web-based demonstration of this clockface. <br> <br>
If that is the case, please vote based on these screenshots of the clockface, and imagine how heckin cool it'd be to have on your wrist: <br>

<br> Now, if you do have a Fitbit OS 5 device, you can proceed to install the clockface <a href="https://gallery.fitbit.com/details/f8d7c96d-a68c-4695-abda-c1d5c27b1067">here</a>. <br>
