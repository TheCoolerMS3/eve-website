    <h1>Here's everything I've ever recieved from Hack Club!</h1>
    I'm writing this at the end of High Seas, and have took part in three Hack Club events:
    <ul>
        <li>Arcade</li>
        <li>High Seas</li>
        <li>Counterspell</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Stuff I got from Arcade</h2>
    <h3>Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W</h3>
    <img src="pizero.jpeg" alt="Image of my Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W" class="centerAdaptiveImg">
    Well, I still haven't used this, as it didn't come with the necessary cables. Still, it's cool to admire the fact that it is so small and cheap, yet it's a full computer! It's SD card has been repurposed to run Android 15 on my Switch - how cool!
    <h3><a href="https://male.dog">male.dog</a></h3>
    A domain for my friend, whose nickname is "Maledog". He... never used this, and now we're on no contact. Aw man.
    <h2>Stuff I got from High Seas</h2>
    <h3>Blahaj</h3>
    <img src="blahaj.jpeg" alt="Image of my Blahaj" class="centerAdaptiveImg">
    I was never a fan of Blahajs until I got one. I'm not a fan of r/traa culture, however, after getting this guy, I've been hugging him to sleep every night. He's approved my life greatly. His name is Ayden and yes I consider him a male.
    <h3>Hack Club 64gb SD Card</h3>
    <img src="sdcard.jpg" alt="Image of my 64gb Hack Club SD Card" class="centerAdaptiveImg">
    I picked this out to go with my phone upgrade to the Nokia C32. It lives on in my phone to this day, storing important files, movies and songs! I like the Hack Club logo, I feel like it's something that'll end up on a Michael MJD video in a few years. Also, it came with some lovely Japanese candy :D 
    <h3>Signed photo of Graham Darcey</h3>
    <img src="signedpic.png" alt="Screenshot of Hack Club Shipment Viewer, showing me that my Signed photo of Graham Darcey is on the way" class="centerAdaptiveImg">
    I'll update this when it arrives, but I am keen to hang this on my wall.
    <h3>Orpheus Pico</h3>
    <img src="opheuspico.png" alt="Screenshot of Hack Club Shipment Viewer, showing me that my Orpheus Pico is on the way" class="centerAdaptiveImg">
    I'll update this when it arrives, but I think this is one of those things that'll be rare one day, I wanna resell it basically. If I need it in a future project though, I will have it :D
    <h3>GitHub Invertocat Pin</h3>
    <img src="githubpin.png" alt="Screenshot of Hack Club Shipment Viewer, showing me that my GitHub Invertocat Pin is on the way" class="centerAdaptiveImg">
    I'll update this when it arrives, but I am keen to pin this to my bag.
    <h3>Swiss Hot Chocolate</h3>
    <img src="hotchoc.png" alt="Screenshot of Hack Club Shipment Viewer, showing me that my hot chocolate is on the way" class="centerAdaptiveImg">
    I'll update this when it arrives, but I'm keen to give it a taste test!
    <h3>Bite Size Linux</h3>
    <img src="bitesizelinux.png" alt="Screenshot of Hack Club Shipment Viewer, showing me that my book thing is on the way" class="centerAdaptiveImg">
    I'll update this when it arrives, but I'm keen to have a read!
    <h3><a href="https://azis.website">azis.website</a></h3>
    I hosted a competition for a free website, and my friend Azi won! If you ever need digital art, go commission her or something, she's amazing at it.
    <h2>Stuff I Got From Counterspell</h2>
    <h3>Counterspell Shirt</h3>
    <img src="counterspelltee.jpeg" alt="Image of my counterspell shirt" class="centerAdaptiveImg">
    At the time I remember thinking "The design on this shirt is better than the one at Miku Expo 2024, and that was ¬£50, so this shirt is basically worth over ¬£50!" The math there is questionable at best, but this certainly is a shirt I like wearing, albeit usually with a second layer because I cannot show my fucked up wrists.
    <h3>Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W (again)</h3>
    Well, the prizes have been delayed quite a bit, so I still don't have this, but I imagine it will be just as cool to look at and do nothing with as the one I already own.
    <h1>Here's what I did to earn them!</h1>
    <h2>Stuff I made for Arcade</h2>
    <h3>Dhilly Game 6 Remake</h3>
    <img src="https://cloud-7e43w925q-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png" alt="Screenshot of Dhilly Game 6 Remake" class="centerAdaptiveImg">

    <img src="https://cloud-262pelv71-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png" alt="Screenshot of the Dhilly Game Website" class="centerAdaptiveImg">
    A website I hacked together for the Dhilly Game franchise, and a spirital successor to the OG Google Site. It's code is lazy and mobile unfriendly, this isn't something I'm proud of but I wanted the doubloons lol

    A Discord bot I hacked together because BotGhost kind of SUCKED at keeping my bot alive, and many people liked it (For some reason?).

    <h3>Eve's Website 3D</h3>
    <img src="https://voluble-genie-a7f1cf.netlify.app/image.png" alt="A screenshot of Eve's Website 3D" class="centerAdaptiveImg">
    I saw a Hack Club YSWS for making 3D websites and got excited, but honestly? It was harder than I thought, and after hours of Stack Overflowing, ChatGPTing, and docs-reading, I just gave up because I couldn't get collisions to work.
    <ul>

    This project is a remake of Dhilly Game 6, and I passinately worked on it for a while for both Arcade and High Seas. High Seas, however, was when I finished it, making it a "trye ship". This deserves ysws bonus imo, but oh well.

    My friend Ivan proposed me to have a bit of a coding session together. We both just kind of.. made really cool websites we otherwise wouldn't have? I'm glad he proposed the idea to me, and I'm glad I made this instead of reusing the (bad) template I had for the previous games.

    <img src="https://cloud-cxaeh5lf6-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png" alt="Screenshot of the Fitbit app" class="centerAdaptiveImg">
    I wanted to store my Co-op membership card on my watch, but while there were many apps for this on Fitbit's gallery, I found them all to be too bloated. I wanted to make a single purpose app for my specific QR code, but thanks to High Seas, I decided to instead make something adaptable that I could share to the world!

    <h3>Murder Diaries</h3>
    I was helping my team make something in Unity, but we couldn't finish it, so I made this backup game. I lost the source code for it, and it's more than a bit messy, but it got us second place!
