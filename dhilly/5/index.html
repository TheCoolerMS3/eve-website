<br>Dhilly Game 5 was known as the definitive Dhilly Game for years, as it came out in May of 2021. This is one month after Dhilly Game 4, four months after Dhilly Game 1, and over 2 years before Dhilly Game 6. <br> <br>
As you can imagine the game had a long time to enter people's hearts, and enter people's hearts it did, many people from the "Dhillers" friend group and me and my friend Stanley's schools enjoyed this game greatly. <br><br>

While Dhilly Game 6 was the first Dhilly Game to receive major attention in the Pxls community, the user "can" famously played this game on Christmas Day of 2022. <br><br>Story is written by my friend Stanley.<br><br>

This is Dhilly Game 5 1.1. Other versions are documented on the <a href="https://dhilly-game.fandom.com/wiki/Dhilly_Game_5">wiki</a>.
